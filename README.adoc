= Building a web application with Gradle

Learn how to build and test a simple web application using Gradle and Open Liberty.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to build and test a simple web servlet application using Gradle.
The `.war` plug-in compiles and builds the application code.
The https://github.com/WASdev/ci.gradle/blob/master/README.md[`liberty` Gradle plug-in] installs the Open Liberty runtime, creates a server, and installs the application to run and test.
The application displays a simple web page with a link. When you click that link, the application calls the servlet to return a simple response of `Hello! Is Gradle working for you?`.

One benefit of using a build tool like Gradle is that after you define the details of the project and any dependencies it has, Gradle automatically downloads and installs the dependencies.

Another benefit of using Gradle is that it can run repeatable, automated tests on the application.
You could, of course, test your application manually by starting a server and pointing a web browser at the application URL.
Automated tests are a much better approach because you can easily rerun the same tests each time the application is built.
If the tests don't pass after you've made a change to the application, the build fails, and you know that you introduced a regression that requires a fix to your code.

Using this guide, you will create a Gradle build definition file (`build.gradle`) for the web application project, and use it to build the application.
You will then create a simple, automated test, and configure Gradle to run it after building the application.

include::{common-includes}/gitclone.adoc[]

== Creating the application

The web application that you will build using Gradle and Open Liberty is provided for you in the `start` directory so that you can focus on learning about Gradle.
The application uses the standard Gradle directory structure.
Using this directory structure saves you from customizing the `build.gradle` file later.

All the application source code, including the Open Liberty server configuration (`server.xml`), is in the `src` directory:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
    └── src
        └── main
           └── java
           └── resources
           └── liberty
                  └── config
           └── webapp
                  └── WEB-INF
----

== Installing Gradle

Now you're ready to install Gradle, if you don't already have Version 3 or higher.
https://gradle.org/install/[The Gradle installation page] gives you alternatives for installing Gradle based on your operating system.

Test that Gradle is installed by running the following command in a command line where you installed Gradle:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
gradle -v
----

If Gradle is installed properly, you should see information about the Gradle installation similar to this line:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
------------------------------------------------------------
Gradle 4.1

== Configure your project

The project configuration is defined in the Gradle settings and build files.
You will create these project configurations one section at a time.

First, create a `settings.gradle` file in the current directory, where you cloned the project (at the same level as the `README.adoc` file):
Add the line to name the project `GradleSample`.

[source]
----
include::finish/settings.gradle[]
----

This `settings.gradle` file isn't required for a single-module Gradle project. Without this definition, by default, the project name will be  the name of the folder in which it is contained (`guide-gradle-intro`).

Create a `build.gradle` file in the current directory where you cloned the project (at the same level as the `settings.gradle` and the `README.adoc` files):

Let's go through the parts of the `build.gradle` file so that you understand each part.

* **Plug-ins**: The plug-ins required to build the project.
* **BuildScript**: Where to find plug-ins for download.
* **Repositories**: Where to find dependencies for download.
* **Dependencies**: Java dependencies that are required for compiling, testing, and running the application are included here. You can also define your Liberty runtime dependency in this section.
* **Liberty**: Configuration for the Liberty plug-in.


You will build the `build.gradle` file piece by piece.
The first information added to the `build.gradle` file defines the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/war_plugin.html[`.war`] and https://github.com/WASdev/ci.gradle/blob/master/README.md[`liberty`] plug-ins that you want to use.
The `.war` plug-in contains all the tasks to compile Java files, build the WAR file structure, and assemble the archive.
The `liberty` plug-in contains the tasks used to install the Liberty runtime and create and manage servers.
The `group`, `version`, and `description` define this project.
The compatibility and encoding settings are for Java.

[source,groovy]
----
include::finish/build.gradle[tag=opening]
----

The `buildscript` section defines where to find the plug-ins you are using in the build.
This guide uses version 2.1 of the `liberty` plug-in, which is available from the Maven Central Repository.

[source,groovy]
----
include::finish/build.gradle[tag=buildscript]
----

The `repositories` section defines where to find the dependencies that you are using in the build.
For this build, everything you need is in Maven Central.

[source,groovy]
----
include::finish/build.gradle[tag=repositories]
----

The `dependencies` section defines what is needed to compile and test the code. This section also defines how to run the application.
The `providedCompile` dependencies are APIs that are needed to compile the application, but do not need to be packaged with the application because Liberty provides the implementation at run time.
For example, the `HelloServlet.java` class depends on `javax.servlet-api` to compile, but since Liberty provides that API, it does not need to be packaged with your application.
The `testCompile` dependencies are needed to compile and run tests.

The `liberty` plug-in provides the `libertyRuntime` dependency definition that specifies the version of the Liberty runtime you want to use.
This project uses Open Liberty 17.0.0.2 or later.
At the time of writing for this guide, Version 17.0.0.3 was used.

Other versions of the https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ccom.ibm.websphere.appserver.runtime[WebSphere Liberty runtime] are also available in Maven Central.

[source,groovy]
----
include::finish/build.gradle[tag=dependencies]
----

The `ext` section shows the Gradle extra properties extension that allows you to add properties to a Gradle project.
If you use a value more than once in your build file, you can simplify updates by defining it as a variable here and referring to the variable later in the build file.
We define variables for the application name, ports, and the context-root.

[source,groovy]
----
include::finish/build.gradle[tag=ext]
----

The next section provides configuration for the `liberty` plug-in.
In the `liberty` extension, we configure the Liberty server, which includes the following settings:

* **name**: The server name.
* **configFile**: The server configuration file.
* **bootstrapProperties**: Bootstrap properties that are written to the server's `bootstrap.properties` file.
* **packageLiberty**: Specifies to only package the `usr` directory in the `build/GradleSample.zip` file.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::finish/build.gradle[tag=liberty]
----

So what's not configured? By default, when the `liberty` and the `.war` plug-ins are applied, the default WAR file is installed to the `apps` folder.
Omitting this definition is the same as including the following line:

[source,groovy]
----
        apps = [war]
----

You can also install applications to the `dropins` folder.

Also, by default, a https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/rwlp_loose_applications.html[loose application] is installed to your Liberty server.
Instead of installing a WAR archive, an XML file (`GradleSample.war.xml`) is installed that describes the location of the application classes, resources, and libraries.
This is useful for development because you only need to recompile your code, rather than repackaging your WAR file to see application updates live on the server.
If you want to turn off loose application support, add the following line:
[source,groovy]
----
        looseApplication = false
----

== Testing the web application

One of the benefits of building an application with a build system like Gradle is that it can be configured to run a set of automated tests.
The `war` plug-in extends the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html[Java plug-in], which provides test tasks.
You can write tests for the individual units of code outside of a running application server (unit tests), or you can write them to call the application that runs on the server (integration tests).
In this example, you will create a simple integration test that checks that the web page opens and that the correct response is returned when the link is clicked.

We configured the Gradle project to start the server with the application installed before running the test. After running the test, the server is stopped.

Create the test class `src/test/java/io/openliberty/guides/hello/it/EndpointIT.java`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/io/openliberty/guides/hello/it/EndpointIT.java[tags=**;!comment]
----

The test class name ends in `it` to indicate that it contains an integration test.
The integration tests are put in the `it` folder by convention.

Configure the Gradle build file to run the integration tests in the `\*/it/**` folder.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::finish/build.gradle[tags=tests]
----

The `systemProperties` configuration defines some variables needed by the test class.
While the port number and context-root information can be hardcoded in the test class, it is better to specify it in a single place like the Gradle `build.gradle` file, in case they need to change.
The `systemProperties` section passes these details to the Java test program as a series of system properties, resolving the `liberty.text.port` and `war.name` variables.

The following lines in the `EndpointIT.java` test class uses these system variables to build the URL of the application:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/io/openliberty/guides/hello/it/EndpointIT.java[tags=URL]
----

In the test class, after defining how to build the application URL, the `@Test` annotation indicates the start of the test method.

In the `try` block of the test method, an HTTP `GET` request to the URL of the application returns a status code.
If the response to the request includes the string `Hello! Is Gradle working for you?`, the test passes.
If that string is not in the response, the test fails.
The HTTP client then disconnects from the application.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::finish/src/test/java/io/openliberty/guides/hello/it/EndpointIT.java[tags=clicklink]
----

In the `import` statements of this test class, you'll notice that the test has some new dependencies.
Earlier we added some `testCompile` dependencies.
The Apache `commons-httpclient` and `junit` dependencies are needed to compile and run the integration test `EndpointIT` class.

The scope for each of the dependencies is set to `testCompile` because the libraries are needed only during the Gradle test phase and do not need to be packaged with the application.

Now, during the build, Gradle installs the application and then runs any integration test classes in the `it` folder.

The directory structure of the project should now look like this example:

[source, role="no_copy"]
----
    └── src
        ├── main
        │  └── java
        │  └── resources
        │  └── webapp
        │         └── WEB_INF
        │  └── liberty
        │         └── config
        └── test
            └── java
----

You can now run the command `gradle build -i` to build the application and test the application.
The `-i` option provides additional information on the command line.
The build takes a little longer than before the test existed, but expect to see the browser opened with the test summary displayed.

To see whether the test detects a failure, change the response string in the servlet `src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/hello/HelloServlet.java` so that it doesn't match the string that the test is looking for.
Then rerun the Gradle integration tests with a `gradle integrationTest -i` command, and check that the test fails.

The complete `build.gradle` file should now look like this example:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::finish/build.gradle[tags=whole]
----

== Great work! You're done!

You built and tested a web application project with an Open Liberty server using Gradle.

You can quickly create this project structure by using the https://liberty-app-accelerator.wasdev.developer.ibm.com/start/[Liberty App Accelerator] and choose to create a Gradle project.
